# bookmark-manager

As a user, 
so that I can see all the things that I've bookmarked, 
I want it to show a list of links. 

As a user, 
so that I can add to my bookmark list, 
I want to be able to add new links. 

As a user, 
so that I can identify links I have saved, 
I want to be able to add tags to the links. 

As a user, 
so that I can find the link I am looking for, 
I want to be able to filter the links by tags.
